You can freely move, copy, or rename directories ARM and RISC-V. 

Do not change/edit ARM.assembler, ARM.system, and *.ini files.
Ini files will be created after you use the SSPARCSS applications
for the first time.

Keep all your assembly programs (*.a) and their translations
into 'executable' files (*.e) in their corresponding directory
ARM or RISC-V.
